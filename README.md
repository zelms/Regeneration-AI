# Regeneration-AI
A model trained to detect saplings

## Work In Progress
This model is still a work in progress. While there is a trained model, I still have yet to create a program to make a smooth user experience, but this is currently being developed. This project should be finished by September 13th.  
There are issues with this repository and once I'm completed there will still be some. I will do my best to improve the README to include better isntructions and to smooth out some bugs.

## Train your own model
I have included all the necessary images and files to train your own model. Open notebook.ipynb with anaconda navigator and change the directories to match your own.

### Troubleshooting
If you are having problems getting this set up, then check out fastai and follow their installation guide.
